description: As my ICS4U (grade 12 level computer science) final examination we were tasked in building the foundation for a website that would be a forum where users could discuss and submit ideas about improving their city. My team's project, of which I was the main developer, was selected by the client and was used as the foundation of democracity.ca. In the process of making this project, I submitted fixes to the Ushahidi framework, most notably fixing their voting system which did not function properly. This was developed in PHP using the Ushahidi framework.
