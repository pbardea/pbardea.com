description: The robot can understand user voice-input and parse the voice input to translate it into a command that can execute, such as where the user would like to go. The robot can play against you by going in a cell where it thinks it is appropriate, determined by its programmed internal logic (of which it has three levels - easy, medium and hard). Programmed using the python programming language and the speech recognition API for python.
